          I recently worked on an e-commerce site which sells sneakers online.
          The name of the site is Statiic. The site aspires to serve the desires
          of all the sneaker heads by giving them an intuitive, robust and
          RELIABLE website where they can find all the sneakers of their
          desires. Here is the link to the code:

          I am double major graduate in Computer Science and Electronics from
          the North West Univeristy (NWU). My undergradute journey was nothing
          short of amazing, although it was really tough, it really broadened my
          horizons and taught me how to utilize my brain to the best of my
          ability. Doing two majors helped me with looking at problems from two
          different perspectives which is a critical skill in software
          development.
